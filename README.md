At Startup-IQ, we designed the SalesDNA Framework for one purpose:

The SalesDNA Framework is designed to provide founders with a practical methodology for diagnosing and improving their Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy before encountering market difficulties.

The Challenge: Misaligned Go-To-Market Strategy

The real danger for startups isn't just capital constraints – it's burning what runway you have on a broken GTM approach.

While most founders focus on hiring more sales reps or boosting marketing spend, they miss the fundamental issue: without alignment between product, ICP, messaging, channels, and sales processes, you're just accelerating toward failure.

Series A founders feel this pain most acutely. As EY notes, with "no immediate rebound in sight, founders will need to shift gears" and be "prepared to do the hard work of managing their capital carefully."

Your SalesDNA: Five Base Pairs That Determine Your Survival

Your startup's GTM health is determined by how well five base pairs are aligned:

This isn't theory – it's been proven across the many founders we engaged during #NY & #SF #techweek.

Why Series A Founders Have the Most to Lose (and Gain)

Series A founders exist in a brutal middle ground:

Too big to pivot easily
Too small to survive misalignment
Too resource-constrained to experiment endlessly

The data confirms it: PitchBook's Q1 2025 analysis confirms the impact of recently announced tariffs, casting a shadow over the remainder of the year. This has led to the postponement of several high-profile IPOs, and a poor liquidity environment is expected to persist. Capital remains scarce with a significant demand/supply imbalance. Consequently, investors are exhibiting a flight to safety, focusing their investments on the most established Series A companies.

In this climate, your SalesDNA isn't just a growth framework – it's your survival kit.
